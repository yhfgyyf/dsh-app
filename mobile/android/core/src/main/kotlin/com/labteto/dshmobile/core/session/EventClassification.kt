/**
 * What this client does with each durable session-event type, stated once.
 *
 * The harness's own vocabulary is a generated list — `KNOWN_SESSION_EVENT_TYPES` in
 * `packages/core/session/src/known-event-types.ts` — and every member of it belongs to exactly one
 * of the three sets below. Nothing here is a guess about what a type *means*; it is a decision
 * about where it belongs on a phone screen, and the decision is written down so a reader can
 * disagree with it.
 *
 * Keeping the sets exhaustive is the point. Before this existed the fold had a literal skip list
 * that had drifted: it named `tool/code-dispatch`, a name the harness renamed to
 * `tool/ptc-dispatch` before this client's own pinned baseline, so PTC dispatch metadata fell
 * through to a raw JSON row in the middle of the transcript. A list nothing compares against is a
 * list that rots quietly, so `EventTypeClassificationTest` compares these three sets to the
 * harness checkout in both directions — a type the harness declares and we do not classify fails,
 * and so does a type we classify that the harness does not declare.
 *
 * None of this removes anything from the record. The fold's `journal` keeps every event verbatim
 * whatever set it lands in, and Trajectory reads the journal, so "log-only" means "not a chat row"
 * rather than "not shown".
