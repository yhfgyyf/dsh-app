 * This is the one exchange in the app that is not the harness wire protocol: the `/relay` routes
 * belong to the relay itself and are never forwarded upstream, so this carries no `client-request`
 * envelope and answers with plain JSON. It lives in `:core` anyway because the parsing is the part
 * worth testing, and the app module has no JVM test harness of its own for network code.
 *
 * The payload version is checked rather than ignored. Everywhere else this client is deliberately
 * lenient — unknown events, frames and tool cards fall through to passthroughs — but a pairing
 * payload is a credential exchange, and a `v` this build does not understand may carry a field it
 * must not silently skip.
