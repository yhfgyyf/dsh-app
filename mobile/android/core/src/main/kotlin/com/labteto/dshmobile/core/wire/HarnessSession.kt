 * the session-log download — against a signed cookie, and answers 401 without one. The only way
 * to obtain that cookie is to present the launch token the harness prints once per process to its
 * *index* route: `GET /?token=…`. The token is deliberately refused on `/api` paths and in an
 * `Authorization` header, so there is no alternative to this exchange and no way to fold it into
 * an ordinary call.
 *
 * This is for **direct** connections. Behind `dsh-relay` the relay holds the harness session and
 * injects it upstream, and a phone that sent the host's cookie across the network would be
 * carrying a credential it has no business holding.
 *
 * Nothing here retries. A refusal means the token is not current, and asking again with the same
 * one produces the same answer.
