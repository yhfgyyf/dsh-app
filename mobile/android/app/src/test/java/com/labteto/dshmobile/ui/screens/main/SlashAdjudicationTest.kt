/**
 * The composer's one decision: command or prompt.
 *
 * It matters both ways. A hit that is treated as a prompt reaches the model as text — which is how
 * picking a permission preset used to make the agent shell out and guess. A miss that is treated as
 * a command would break skills, which are invoked precisely by sending `/name` as a prompt.
