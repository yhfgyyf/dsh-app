/**
 * The credential has to be on the unary calls *and* on the WebSocket upgrade.
 *
 * The upgrade is the half that is easy to miss and expensive to miss: the connection loop opens
 * `/api/remote.mux` and gives it 3000ms, and a relay refuses an upgrade with no `Authorization`
 * at the handshake. That surfaces as "the stream would not open", which reads like a firewall or
 * a VPN — everything except the one thing it is.
