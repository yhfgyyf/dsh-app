/**
 * The client, against the real relay.
 *
 * Every other relay test in this repo runs against [MockHarness] — a stand-in written from reading
 * the plugin. That is the one thing those tests cannot check: a misreading would be baked into both
 * the client and the mock, and every assertion would still pass. This drives the actual
 * `dsh-relay` implementation, so the pairing shape, the header it wants, the status it answers
 * with, and the key it publishes are checked against the code that will really be on the other end.
 *
 * Skipped unless the plugin's sources are on this machine and Node can run them, so CI and anyone
 * without the relay checked out are unaffected. Set `DSH_RELAY_SRC` to run it against a
 * different checkout.
 *
 * The relay is deliberately configured with `compat.addressGrants: false`. That bridge accepts a
 * request purely because of the address it came from, and leaving it on would let every request
 * here through whether or not the bearer token was ever attached — which is the whole thing under
 * test.
