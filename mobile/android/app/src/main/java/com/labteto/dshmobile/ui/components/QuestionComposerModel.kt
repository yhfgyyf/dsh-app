/**
 * The question composer's answer logic, kept out of the Compose layer so it can be tested — a port
 * of the harness web client's `QuestionFlow`
 * (`packages/client/ui-user-questions/src/client/QuestionComposer.tsx`) and its `planReviewOf`
 * (`.../src/client/contract/slots.ts`).
 *
 * The encoding is not a matter of taste. The host validates an answer batch against the exact
 * request it resolves (`matchesQuestions`, `packages/host/apiproxy/src/api-proxy.ts`) and refuses
 * the *whole* batch on any single violation — and a refusal is not a retry: the receipt says
 * `bad-response`, the wait stays pending, and the `ask_user_question` call that opened it never
 * unblocks. So the rules below are the mirror of that function, and the tests pin them one by one.
