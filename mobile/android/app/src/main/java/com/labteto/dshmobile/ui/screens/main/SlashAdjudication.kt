 * Decide whether a draft is a command or a prompt — the port of the harness web client's

 *
 * The order matters, and the misses matter as much as the hits: a `/` line that names nothing in
 * the catalog falls through to [Submission.Prompt] on purpose, because that is how skills are
 * invoked — the host's pre-step boundary recognises the leading `/name` and injects the skill body.
 * Adjudicating against the catalog first is what keeps a skill that shares a name with a command
 * resolving to the command.
 *
 * Attachments are adjudicated here for the same reason the harness adjudicates them in its
 * composer: the host refuses them per command, and a refusal that arrived after dispatch would
 * have already cost the user their draft. Since harness 0.1.3 a command declares `attachments`
 * rather than `images`, and the flag covers files as well as pictures.
 *
 * @param draft the composer's raw text.
 * @param catalog the session's command catalog (`commands/list`); empty means every line is a prompt.
 * @param attachments how many attachments — images or files — ride along.
 * @param hostAcceptsAttachments whether this harness's `commands/execute` carries attachments at
 *   all (`SessionStore.commandAttachmentsSupported`).
