 * What the connect form's host field actually said.

 * People paste what they have, and what they have is usually a URL: the line the harness printed,
 * the address bar of the working web GUI, a reverse proxy's `https://agent.home`. Handing that
 * string to DNS as a hostname is how "https://agent.home" came to be diagnosed as a computer that
 * does not exist (#6). This type keeps the three facts a URL can carry apart, so the caller can
 * decide what fills the gaps.
