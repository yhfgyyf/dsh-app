/**
 * One remembered harness endpoint, reached directly or through a `dsh-relay`.
 *
 * The `last*` fields cache the newest `host.describe` so a Recent card can say what the harness is
 * before its liveness probe lands — and can still say it about a harness that is now switched off.
 * They all default, because the whole list is persisted as one JSON blob whose decode failure is
 * swallowed: a field without a default would silently wipe every remembered host on upgrade. That
 * applies just as much to the relay fields below, which is why every one of them has a default even
 * though a paired relay always has three of them set.
 *
 * The bearer token is deliberately **not** here. This record is serialized into plain DataStore;
 * the credential lives in [RelayCredentialStore], keyed by [id].
