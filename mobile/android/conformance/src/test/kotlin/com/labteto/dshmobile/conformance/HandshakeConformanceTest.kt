/**
 * Connecting to a real harness, and the two refusals that decide what the app tells the person.
 *
 * These are the cases `:mock-harness` cannot model at all. It implements no `GET /?token=` route,
 * issues no cookie and has no 401 — it only knows the relay's bearer scheme, which answers 403 — so
 * the authentication tier that every directly-connected user is on has never been checked against
 * anything but this client's own idea of it. Since harness 0.1.2 that tier is the whole `/api`
 * surface.
 *
 * The 401/403 split is the part worth pinning. They need opposite remedies: a 403 is about where
 * the request came from and is fixed on the harness, a 401 is about who is asking and is fixed by
 * exchanging a launch token. Collapsing them sends people to reconfigure a firewall when they
 * actually need to re-pair, which is exactly what the connect screen's copy turns on.
